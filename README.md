# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This is designed to be a dynamic study guide tool
- Developers need reference tools to keep track of information
- This guide will handily provide quick references for each section we cover
- What did you learn? I'm pretty new to coding, so all the html elements and css elements were new.  I'm somewhat familiar with the logic elements we discussed in the JavaScript Section

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
